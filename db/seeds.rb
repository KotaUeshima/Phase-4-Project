# Blog.create(user_id: 1, content: "My name is Kota Ueshima, and I am currently a junior at the University of Southern California studying Business Administration with an emphasis in International Relations. I am interested in pursuing the Intern Advisory Transformation Delivery Summer 2022 position at KPMG this year. I am thoroughly drawn to the company’s close-knit family culture, dedication to quality work, and drive for innovation. 

# My past experiences and internships have helped me develop a diverse set of perspectives and skills that allow me to find success as an intern at KPMG. First, having grown up across three continents, I have personally witnessed and recognized the dramatic societal differences of diverse populations. This has allowed me to keep an open mindset, understanding that interpersonal connections rely on a full comprehension of others’ upbringing and cultural background. Second, I have exemplified a propensity of employing critical thinking within research situations, an ability to communicate effectively to others, and an aptitude for finding success in a team setting. 

# Critical Thinking and Research: This past summer, I was given the opportunity to intern at Takenaka Partners, a boutique investment bank that also provides advisory services for international clients. At my time at the firm, I was tasked with developing Greenfield Research reports, one of Takenaka’s premier, value-added services, which provide key market research through conducting audits of potential target companies for client M&As. By efficiently narrowing down company lists through the use of Capital IQ and public financial documents, I was able to create 5+ Greenfield Research models that aligned with the requirements and requests of each client, companies generally ranging from $10 million to $200 million valuations. This process involved an in-depth understanding of the client’s outlook and capabilities, especially factoring in the willingness for firms to be acquired by an international customer, and vice versa. My highly detail-oriented work ethic to understand a client’s needs and implementing it towards their goals will be valuable assets for KPMG.

# Communication Skills: As the marketing lead for a consulting project with LinkedIn, I was able to exemplify my capabilities of communicating effectively and efficiently in a professional setting, both to the client, LinkedIn, and the target for the project, members of the Central Mother Lode Regional Consortium, a collective of Californian community colleges. Over the course of the project, I successfully presented our team’s marketing campaign to the client, all of which was widely accepted, as the Regional Consortium is currently undergoing our methods of implementation. These skills are easily transferable to the client-focused work at KPMG.

# Teamwork: At the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Stars Program, I led a team of four other interns through a summer-long research project. Within the first four weeks of the project, my team had made little to no progress from where we had started, as our Polymerase Reaction Chain (PCR) and Protein Expression tests consistently came back negative. As team lead, I took it upon myself to find a solution to our problems, primarily through the help of professional mentors at the Medical Center. While we were able to get back on track, our project was significantly behind schedule. By communicating efficiently and directly to my team, I was able to get them on board to work extra hours for the rest of the project so we could finish before the deadline. I believe that my ability to problem solve within a collaborative setting will be a key tool within the various team projects at KPMG.

# I believe that my strong work ethic, willingness to learn, in combination with my collaborative abilities and analytical thinking will make me an impactful intern at KPMG. Thank you for your time in considering my application and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

# Respectfully,
# Kota Ueshima
